## Opensea Study Project

Opensea study project was to gather and analyze a wide range of data from multiple fields.

## How does it work?

The OpenSea study project works in two different ways. First, it gathers data from multiple sources (e.g., a range of documents, such as manuals, brochures, and reports, and a range of industry experts and end users) to obtain a comprehensive picture of the actual risks of the O&G industry. Secondly, it uses a number of methods to determine the impact of different factors on the actual risks.
